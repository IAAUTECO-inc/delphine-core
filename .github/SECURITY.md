## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take all security bugs in this project seriously. 
Thank you for improving the security of our project. We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

All security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to us.
Please **DO NOT** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Instead, please report them through GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature.
You can find more information on how to do that here:
